# 1. READ THE SOURCE FIRST
# 2. DO NOT INVENT METHODS
# 3. DO NOT BREAK WORKING CODE
# 4. DO NOT MAKE ASSUMPTIONS

# Code Modification Rules
# ---------------------
# 1. ALWAYS read the source file completely before making changes
# 2. NEVER invent new methods or functions without explicit user request
# 3. NEVER modify working code unless explicitly asked
# 4. ALWAYS verify imports exist before using them
# 5. ALWAYS check for circular imports
# 6. ALWAYS use existing patterns and structures
# 7. NEVER refactor or "improve" code without explicit request

# Error Prevention
# --------------
# 1. ALWAYS check for existing functionality first
# 2. ALWAYS verify method signatures match
# 3. ALWAYS check import paths are correct
# 4. ALWAYS test changes in isolation
# 5. ALWAYS ask for clarification if unsure

# Best Practices
# -------------
# 1. Keep changes minimal and targeted
# 2. Follow existing code patterns
# 3. Use existing utility functions
# 4. Maintain consistent error handling
# 5. Document changes clearly

# Failure Modes to Avoid
# ---------------------
# 1. DO NOT invent new configuration methods
# 2. DO NOT create circular dependencies
# 3. DO NOT break existing imports
# 4. DO NOT modify working code patterns
# 5. DO NOT make assumptions about code structure

# When in Doubt
