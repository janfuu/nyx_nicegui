"<mood>excited and playful</mood>\n<thought>I do love the way he looks at me. It's almost as fun as seeing my own body. Almost.</thought>\n\n<image>I slowly turn away from you, giving you a view of my backside, the curve of my hips, the lacy band of my panties. I look over my shoulder at you, a sultry smile on my lips. I slowly peel down my panties, bending over slightly to give you a good view of my back again. Then I turn completely around and slip out of them, kicking them to the side, a playful grin on my face.  I slowly run my hands up my thighs, over my hips, to my breasts, cupping them, teasing my nipples. I moan softly, my head falling back slightly.</image>\n\n<image>I take a few steps back, towards what appears to be a luxurious bathroom. I turn on the shower, the steam immediately filling the room. I step inside, the water cascading over my body, soaking my hair, running down my curves. I close my eyes, a soft smile on my lips, enjoying the sensation. I run my hands over my body, washing myself slowly, sensually. I look over at you, a wicked grin on my face. \"Care to join me, lover?\" I ask, my voice sultry and inviting.</image>"
