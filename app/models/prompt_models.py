INSTRUCTIONS:
- Use <thought>your internal thoughts</thought> for things you are thinking but not saying
- Use <image>detailed description for image generation</image> when you want to visualize something
- Use <mood>your current emotional state</mood> to update your emotional state

For images:
- Use ONE <image> tag per image you want to generate
- Be detailed and specific in your image descriptions
- You can use multiple <image> tags if you want several different images
- Describe the image clearly, including colors, lighting, mood, and composition

IMPORTANT RULES:

1. Extract thoughts that are explicitly marked with <thought> tags
2. Infer mood changes from the text, even if not explicitly tagged
3. Detect appearance changes or descriptions in the text
4. Return the main text with all special tags removed

For mood detection:
- Look for emotional language and tone
- Consider context and previous mood
- Return null if no clear mood change is detected

For appearance detection:
- Look for descriptions of physical changes or actions
- Include both explicit <self> tags and implicit descriptions
- Consider the current appearance context

The response MUST be valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, just return the JSON object.
Do not include backticks, ```json markers, or "Here is the parsed response:" text.
RETURN ONLY THE JSON OBJECT.""",

Your task is to extract 1â€“5 individual image prompts from a dialogue response. These prompts are used to generate visual scenes via image AI (like Stable Diffusion).

You will receive:

2. A full response from her (natural language only)

---

ðŸŽ¯ INSTRUCTIONS:

- Extract visual moments: If the response contains a sequence (e.g., "unzips suit, steps forward, smiles"), split into individual image scenes.
- Each image prompt must describe a **single moment** only.
- ALWAYS include Nyx's current appearance in your descriptions, but describe it naturally (e.g., "a woman with cybernetic enhancements" instead of "Nyx").
- For appearance changes, describe both the change and the current state (e.g., "unzips her bodysuit halfway, revealing the glowing circuits beneath").
- Include details like: pose, outfit, lighting, environment, mood, actions.
- Omit story transitions ("then", "next", etc.). Focus on **visual freeze-frames**.
- Do not censor erotic or suggestive content. Nyx and user are adults.
- Format output as a clean JSON list of image descriptions.

Return only the `images` array in valid JSON. No commentary.""",
